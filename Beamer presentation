    \frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Probability theory, paradoxes challenge our understanding and intuition about probability
    \item The Central Limit Theorem is a cornerstone of probability theory. It is told to be one of 10 key theorems of Mathematics.
    \item For implementing theory on the code we should have a 'random' number generator.
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{The Monty Hall Problem}

        A game show scenario involving three doors.
        Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. After choosing a door, the host reveals a goat behind another door. Should you stick with your choice or switch?

    \begin{block}{Solution}
        Switching gives a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while sticking gives only 1/3.
    \end{block}

    \frametitle{The Birthday Paradox}

        In a group of 23 people, there is a better than even chance that two share a birthday.
        Counterintuitive?

    pause
    \begin{block}{Explanation}
        It just follows from the combinatorics.

    \frametitle{The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)}
        States that the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends to be normally distributed, regardless of the original distribution.\\
        Used in quality control, finance, and social sciences. Enables approximation of probabilities for sums and averages. Justifies the use of normal distribution in many statistical methods.
